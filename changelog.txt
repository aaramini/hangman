
v2.0.0

Refactored the code a bit to make it cleaner and more readable. Added comments
for clarity. Should be easier to follow the code...(less spaghetti, more ravioli).


With the exception of display_game (which takes 3 arguments), all functions now
do not need any arguments passed to them.

*	Renamed the main body function, play_game(), to start_game()
 

Removed 2 functions...

The following functions took too many arguments and were removed:

*	Removed draw_art(), a one line function that just printed the appropriate graphic
	from the graphics list. The line has been incorporated into the display_game()
	function on line 54.

*	Removed check_guess function and incorporated the logic/functionality into
	start_game() on lines 86-91.

Added 1 function...

*   game_exit() - a cleaner and way to exit than calling os._exit(1). Since this
    function is explicitly called when the user wants to quit, traceback is
    suppressed and we just print "Good Bye!"
    


Renamed 3 variables to make their purpose clearer:

*	start_game() local variable a was renamed to correct_letters
    
*	replay() local variable a was renamed to ans (shorthand for answer)
    
*	count was renamed to guesses_left

*	With the exception of graphics (because it's a huge list containing ASCII art)
	all global variables were moved to start_game() and are now locals
