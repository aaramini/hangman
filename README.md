Hangman word guessing game with ASCII art graphics v2.0.0
Language: Python 3/Python console (sorry not a modern GUI)
Released: Jan 9, 2018
Files: ex32-hangman_v2.0.0.py, sowpods.zip

ex32-hangman_v2.0.0.py - The Hangman game script/source code

(ex32 stands for exercise 32 on PracticePython.org (http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/10/32-hangman.html) and has nothing to do with 32-bit or win32 exe, etc. It was written on Windows 7 using Python 3.6.4 and NotePad++v7.5.4.

sowpods.zip - contains a 2.94MB text file, sowpods.txt, that the python script needs to work.

sowpods.txt is just a text file containing Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word. The original source for this file is:
http://norvig.com/ngrams/sowpods.txt

Extract sowpods.txt from the zip and place ex32-hangman_v2.0.0.py and sowpods.txt in the same directory before running the ex32-hangman_v2.0.0.py file.

Installation:

For the game to run without modifying the code, you need to have Python 3 installed. It is also dependent upon 4 standard Python libraries: os, sys, random and string.

In this version:

Refactored the code a bit to make it cleaner and more readable. Added comments for clarity. Should be easier to follow the code...(less spaghetti, more ravioli).

Why bother with a stupid hangman game, this git, and all this docs?...

I'm just a n00b to programming and never even had a GitHub account before. So I am going through the exercises at PracticePython.org, and using GitHub as a place to dump my solutions to the exercises. But I am wanting to do it well and learn good habits, instead of being lazy and sloppy on purpose (as to my code...well...3 weeks in to Python so it's destined to look like slop to a seasoned coder).

I am not interested in interacting with people who do some clever one line comprehension to prove how "smart" they are. What good is it if neither I nor anyone else can read it or understand WTF is going on in the code?? I am trying to actually learn this stuff, and gain a solid understanding.

I once read an article about the famous FizzBuzz problem. The comments started out relating to the article's main point, that a lot of recent college grads who applied for a programming job, couldn't even write a FizzBuzz. However, the comments section quickly turned into a bunch of programmers posting their "solution", as if they were trying to prove their worth. It then devolved into a pissing contest where people were trying to post the shortest/most clever FizzBuzz solution.

I really don't care if you can do it in 2 lines or 5 million lines! I am not interested in working with or trying to learn from these one-uppers types of people. I think their own ego gets in their way. I think there are genius programmers out there, they do exist. But I also think that a lot of average or non-genius tech minded people tend to THINK they are geniuses. (The same thing happens in IT, which is my background, and other tech driven areas. I don't know why IT/Techie/Programmer types tend to be arrogant, self-important, or are so insecure that they have to show off how "great" they are every chance they get. It's childish IMHO. In the age of information, one can know a lot, but one can never know it all.

I don't wish to be spoon-fed. I don't wish to show off. I want keep an open mind, learn as much as I can and I'm willing to put in the work required to learn.

While I'm not even sure that I want to program for a living, for now I am just learning for fun.
